    "Hello everyone, this assignment notebook covers Tree-Based Models. There are some code-completion tasks and question-answering tasks in this answer sheet. For code completion tasks, please write down your answer (i.e., your lines of code) between sentences that \"Your code starts here\" and \"Your code ends here\". The space between these two lines does not reflect the required or expected lines of code. For answers in plain text, you can refer to [this Markdown guide](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-ultimate-markdown-guide-for-jupyter-notebook-d5e5abf728fd) to customize the layout (although it shouldn't be needed).\n",

Note that the method returns not the values themselves but the indices of the values. By giving you this method, we can ensure that everyone should get the exact same result, as well as that the results will match with the Decision Tree implementation of scikit-learn. For example, `create_split()` puts all samples `<=` then the threshold into the left child node (and all others into the right child node). However, there would be no principle difference to put them in the right child node (and all others into the left child node). It's purely a convention to ensure consistency.

    "In this last part, we look into evaluating different tree-based models using k-fold cross validation. K-fold cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to assess the performance and generalization ability of a model. It involves dividing the dataset into K subsets (or \"folds\") of equal size. The model is trained on K-1 of these folds and tested on the remaining one. This process is repeated K times, with each fold used as the test set exactly once. The final performance metric is computed by averaging the results from each iteration. K-fold cross-validation helps ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data, reducing the risk of overfitting or underfitting.\n",

    "<p>Based on above implementation, RandomForestRegressor can be considered as the best model as it gives a very good trade-off between performance and computational run time. There are additional things that need to be considered to better evaluate the performance of models and hence subsequently do model selection. With limited testing and limited use of parameters, it does not give enough confidence in model selection.</p>\n",
    "<p>However, as seen from the plots, none of the regressor have crossing lines for training and testing (also there is a noticeable and significant gap in training and testing validation lines) indicating that these models may not be generalizing the concept well enough.</p>\n",
    "<p>There is a need to perform EDA with much better understanding of the domain knowledge, and this might help models to generalize the concepts better than the current implementation.</p>\n",
    "<p>There is concern about the limited metrics as only RMSE is considered. This definitely impacts the model selection. There should be other metrics such as R<sup>2</sup> need to be also considered to better evaluate the model.</p>\n",
    "<p>There is also one more concern that this only uses max_depth as a parameter. Other parameters such as min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf, etc need to be used in combination and isolation and measure the performance by thorough testing. This would lead to more confidence in model selection.</p>"
